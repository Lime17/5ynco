# HOW TO GET STARTED
This is a quick startup guide to get you all the tools you need to start working on this project. For coding tips/resources, check the end of the page.
## Downloading GitHub Desktop
To download the desktop app, use [this link](https://desktop.github.com/) (you are able to use the website exclusively, however it is HIGHLY recommended you use an external editor to code more efficiently). After downloading and signing into your account, click the green Code button on the website page [(seen here)](https://i.imgur.com/mIRZsMe.png) and open in GitHub Desktop. It'll probably prompt you to choose an install path. Just leave it default.
## Downloading Visual Studio Code
(Optional if you already have a code editing software you already use).
To download Code, use [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). This is the primary software you will use to edit your code. It's like an advanced notepad that can format your HTML, CSS, etc. automatically. There are also some extentions you can download to experiment with the website before updating it on GitHub. The one we'll be using is Live Server.
### Downloading Live Server
When in Visual Studio, open the [extentions tab](https://i.imgur.com/mvLu05f.png), and search for Live Server. It should be the first option and you'll be able to click the small blue install button below it. This will allow you to run a local version of the website, where you can update the page and see your changes in real time! After it finishes installing, you can click the Go Live button in the [bottom right](https://i.imgur.com/PeriMDT.png) to activate the server.
## Pushing changes with GitHub Desktop
Before making any changes, you should change which branch you are using. You can do that by clicking on the top middle of your GitHub Desktop page and selecting new branch. If you are given the option to bring your changes to the new branch select that. It should look something [like this.](https://i.imgur.com/BQGGt4Z.png) Once your new branch is selected, you can Commit (title/select) your changes and Push origin (upload it to GitHub). Once uploaded, it should prompt you to create a pull request, which will allow others to verify your code and ensure it is working properly. Clicking that should bring you to [this page,](https://i.imgur.com/GjWEISa.png) where you can detail your changes and press the big green "Create pull request" button. And you're all set! Now someone can review your changes and push it to the main branch, or leave some suggestions on ways to improve your code!
